We provide 2 main options for the server.

1. PwOSS - Image and the documentation "(Image Docu).md" file = Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 (3B+ not Supported, yet)
2. Arch Linux | ARM starting from scratch with our "(Scratch Docu).md" file = Based on Raspberry

> 64 Bit:  
> If we get more time we want to check the "(Scratch Docu).md" file on a 64 Bit Arch system.
> Seafile server download - link needs to be changed and cower isn't in the official Arch repo - > use makepkg instead ([Archlinux link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg))).


> Other ARM devices:  
> It would be perfect if you could help with other ARM devices. The scratch file should work on all ARM devices (ArchLinux | ARM - Images).
