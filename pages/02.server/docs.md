We provide 2 options for the server.

1. Image (Image Docu) = Raspberry Pi 1, 2 and 3 (3B+ not Supported, yet)
2. Full Documentation (Full Docu) = Based on Raspberry but should work on all Arch Based OS. (Not tested) (Seafile Server can be a different way).

Option 2 isn't tested on a 64Bit Arch System right now. But if you like you can use option 2 if you're running an ARM architecture and if you want to start from scratch.
