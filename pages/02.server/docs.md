We provide 2 options for the server.

1. PwOSS - Image and the documentation "(Image Docu).md" file = Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 (3B+ not Supported, yet)
2. Arch Linux | ARM starting from scratch with our "(Scratch Docu).md" file = Based on Raspberry

Option 2 isn't tested on a 64Bit Arch System right now but it should work on all Arch Based OS.
(Not tested) (Seafile server download - link needs to be changed).
