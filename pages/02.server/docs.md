We offer 2 ways for the server.

1. PwOSS - Image and the documentation "(Image Docu).md" file = Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 (3B+ not Supported, yet)
2. Arch Linux | ARM starting from scratch with our "(Scratch Docu).md" file = Based on Raspberry

> 64 Bit:  
> If we get more time we want to check the "(Scratch Docu).md" file on a 64 Bit Arch system.
> Seafile server download - link needs to be changed, LUKS installation needs to be changed and cower isn't in the official Arch 64 Bit repo - use makepkg instead ([Archlinux link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg)).

> Other ARM devices:  
> It would be perfect if you could help with other ARM devices. The scratch file should work on all ARM devices [archlinuxarm.org](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms).
