# Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is the most popular single-board computer.

It's perfectly made (amongst other things) to get a running server at your home. It doesn't cost much power and it's small so it fits everywhere.

The image (operating system) what we provide is for the Pi 2&3. The Raspberry Pi 3B+ isn't supported yet.
