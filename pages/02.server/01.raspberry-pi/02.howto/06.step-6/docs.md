### Primary DNS Server

Done? Did you reboot your server? Everything seems to be fine?  
Good!

Last step will be to change the DNS server. This is necessary to get every device through Pi-Hole.
Login in to your router and change the "primary DNS server" under "DHCP-Server".
> This can be named differently. Depends on your router.

Delete the "secondary DNS server" and save it.
> Might be necessary to re-login all your connected devices to your WIFI/LAN.

That's it.
