### Port Forwarding
You’ll need the port forwarded to your Raspberry Pi - IP (192.168.1.76 <- can be this one).

> [www.noip.com](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/) has a good list of some router brands.

The 1194 (udp) port needs to be open in your router for the [VPN connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) (Wikipedia link).

> If your router isn’t listed? Just ask us or the [forum](https://forum.pwoss.xyz/).
