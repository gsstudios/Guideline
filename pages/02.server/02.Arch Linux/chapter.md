# Arch Linux

You can initially follow the ([guideline](https://guideline.pwoss.xyz/linux/arch)) to install Arch.  
And follow the “PwOSS - Server | Raspberry - Archlinux | ARM - (Scratch Docu).md” file in the "PwOSS - Server / 1. Raspberry Pi / Arch Linux | ARM / Arch Linux | ARM - (Scratch Docu)" folder from our Seafile server or the file from GitHub.

[Seafile link](https://seafile.pwoss.xyz/d/1215a57671da473cadbe)  
[GitHub link])(need to change the repos first)

> Seafile server download - link needs to be changed, LUKS installation has to be changed and cower isn't in the official Arch 64 Bit repo - use makepkg instead ([Archlinux link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg)
