# other ARM devices

If you want to try another ARM device like the Banana Pi you could check the “PwOSS - Server | Raspberry - Archlinux | ARM - (Scratch Docu).md” file in the "PwOSS - Server / 1. Raspberry Pi / Arch Linux | ARM / Arch Linux | ARM - (Scratch Docu)" folder from our Seafile server or the file from GitHub.

The scratch file should work on all ARM devices - [archlinuxarm.org](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms).
