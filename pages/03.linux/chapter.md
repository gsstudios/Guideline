# Linux

If you don't want Windows, Mac etc. anymore you'll find here a **HowTo** for two good operating systems for your computer.

### Linux Mint

### &

### Manjaro Linux

__(optional and only recommended if you want to learn more: Arch Linux)__

Both are brilliant user friendly distros (operating systems) especially if you're coming from Windows.
