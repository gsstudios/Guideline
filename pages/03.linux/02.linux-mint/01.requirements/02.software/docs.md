## Linux Mint

[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/download.php) – link

There are different versions. If you have an older PC and less than 4GB ram you can go with the 32bit and Xfce. Xfce – desktop environment is more lightly than the other versions but the look isn’t that good but it’ll be quick enough to work with. If you have 4GB ram and more go with the 64 bit version (depends on your Hardware. [64 bit or 32 bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#32-bit_vs_64-bit)? – Wikipedia link) and Cinnamon. Cinnamon is a good choice but the others are good too. Every version has their own strength and weaknesses. Here is an overview of the different versions [quora.com](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-good-comparison-between-Cinnamon-Xfce-KDE-and-MATE-Which-one-should-I-choose).
