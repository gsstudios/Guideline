## Manjaro Linux

[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/get-manjaro/) – link

There are different versions. If you have an older PC or less than 4GB ram you can go with the Xfce  desktop environment. Xfce – desktop environment is more lightly than the other versions but the look isn’t that good but it’ll be quick enough to work with. If you have 4GB ram and more you can choose for example KDE.
Every version has their own strength and weaknesses. Here is an overview of the different versions [quora.com](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-good-comparison-between-Cinnamon-Xfce-KDE-and-MATE-Which-one-should-I-choose).
Why not 32bit or 64bit? Arch (Manjaro) is only available in 64bit.
