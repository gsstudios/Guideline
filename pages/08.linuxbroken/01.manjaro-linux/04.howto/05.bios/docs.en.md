## Manjaro Linux

You have to align the boot-start to your USB-Stick.

Depending on your motherboard, you must press the “esc” or “f2” or “f12” or “end” key immediately after the PC starts.
(check your motherboard/computer manual if no button works).

Reboot and choose Start: Boot Manjaro.x86_64 kde.

(After installing your operating system, you need to change back your BIOS settings)
