Quick info about the “how we do it”.

We're choosing the most efficient way ... in our eyes. We know, there are a lot of other possibilities out there. It’s not like you have to get the same hardware or software. We just want to keep it as simple as possible mostly for "normal" users. At no great cost for hardware and entertain, especially with an eye on power bills.

Few ‘known’ info straightaway:

    We know, that a Raspberry Pi can’t reach the full speed on USB.
    We know, there is Nextcloud.
    We know, the Nexus is great but a low budget phone can be great as well.
    We know, these and that but we also know that we don’t know everything.
    So, you’re very welcome to join the Community and share your ideas or get help. But please stay calm and be always friendly. Thanks.
