Magisk is now the most used way to get root access. <br>
Back in the days, it was _Chainfire's - SuperSU_, but it was sold to a Chinese company and was no longer trustworthy.
Magisk is open source and became more and more popular after the years. Magisk is actually more than just _to get root access_. It supports modules which could provide apps, tweaks or services. Some applications (bank apps/NFC/games/etc.) will not work if you have a rooted phone, but with Magisk it possible to hide the _root check_ of the certain apps. This hiding capability may eventually stop working as Google makes these checks stricter.
