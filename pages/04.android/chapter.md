# Android


## Background
Android is one of the main operating systems (OS) you will find on a smartphone today. It was developed by Google to compete directly with iOS, the operating system found on iPhones. One of the main reasons why Android was so successful was because it could run on many devices thanks to the Open Handset Alliance (OHA), an initiative that would allow manufacturers such as Samsung and LG to develop smartphones that may look and feel different, but still at the same time run the same operating system (with modifications made by the manufacturer).

Google may have prevented a monopoly that may have otherwise existed should Android have never existed, however it isn't all without some catch. Google is notorious for collecting large amounts of private user data, whether you're on a desktop, laptop, or smartphone. On all (Google certified) smartphones, there must be a Play Store and some Google apps (varies between devices). These apps, while useful for a large majority of users, can extract extensive amounts of information based on the user's search history and etc. However, there are solutions to prevent this and hence re-iterates the need of a guide such as this one. 

## The general process 

The main tutorial is based on a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (2014), however the same steps may be replicated in a similar way for other devices.

It all started with the 'HTC HD2' which was released 2009 ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_HD2)). The HTC HD2 was well-known for having excellent support by the development community, which in-turn sparked the interests of power users and other developers to support other devices too. As time went by, we went through a bunch of phones which were always rooted.

Since then, nothing has changed much. The procedure has always been the same.

1. Custom Recovery
2. Root
3. ROM
4. Apps

Over the years, it was necessary to get the bootloader open for different phones like the Nexus-line (now discontinued) of smartphones from Google.
