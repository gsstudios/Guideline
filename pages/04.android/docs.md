# Android

Here you'll find examples how to get rid of Google and other important stuff to keep your privacy.
It'll be mostly similar ways but the main tutorial is based on a 'Samsung Galaxy Note 4".

We started once with a 'HTC HD2' which was released 2009 ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_HD2)). So we went already through of a bunch of phones which were always rooted. And by the way, the HD2 was by far the best phone for customizing your phone!

Since then, nothing changed much. The main princip was always the same.

1.Custom Recovery
2.Root
3.Rom
4.Apps

Over the years, it was necessary to get the bootloader open for different certain phones like the Nexus of Google. 

It's might be not the same way but mostly they're similar possible ways! Check the following page for support of your phone.
