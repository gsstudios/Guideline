**LineageOS** is an open-source operating system (OS) for your Android device. In the development community, it is often referred to as a __custom ROM__ (or sometimes aftermarket firmware). Android is generally open-source ([AOSP - Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/)), however the Google Apps (GApps) or other manufacturer (Samsung, HTC, ...) applications aren't.
