# Why bother installing a custom ROM?

We are all familiar with the time where your phone decides to play up and refuses to do what you want it to do. Anecdotal evidence has found that **all** smartphones degrade over time due to heat, stress, wear and etc. However this __doesn't__ mean you can't still make improvements on your phone.

One common cause of slowdowns on your smartphone is the presence of bloatware or "bloat". These apps are **unneeded** and **unwanted**, meaning that they take up your important storage space and memory. A custom ROM however **never** contains any bloatware. This will mean that you will be able to reclaim any of the lost storage space and memory and use it for more important applications. This will translate to **better** performance (and sometimes battery life).

# Custom ROM options

LineageOS isn't the only custom ROM available. There are heaps of other ROMs you can choose from (Resurrection Remix, CR Droid, Paranoid Android, etc.), each coming with their own unique combination of features and apps.
To get started, it is best to consult on a thread over at the XDA-developers forums ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDA_Developers)). XDA is the first address of all your Android needs.

Like other desktop-operating systems (Arch, Debian, Mint, Ubuntu etc.) you have to find out for yourself which ROM suits **you** best.
