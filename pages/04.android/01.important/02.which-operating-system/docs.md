**LineageOS** is open source and __the Custom-ROM__ (operating system) for Android. Android generally is open source ([AOSP - Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/)). Only the Google Apps (GApps) or other manufacturer (Samsung, HTC, ...) application aren't open source.

Mostly every Custom-ROM is based on LineageOS. The explaination of the Custom-ROMs will be in the thread of XDA ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDA_Developers)) where you can get your ROM. XDA is the first address of all your Android needs. 

Almost every ROM based on LineageOS has more customization options. Like other desktop-operating systems (Arch, Debian, Mint, Ubuntu etc.) you have to find out for yourself which ROM suits you best.
