LineageOS is open source and __the__ Custom-ROM (operating system) for Android. Android generally is open source ([AOSP - Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/)). Only the Google Apps (GApps) or other manufacturer (Samsung, HTC, ...) application aren't open source.

Mostly every Custom-ROM is based on LineageOS. The explaination of the Custom-ROMs will be in the thread of XDA ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDA_Developers)) where you can get your ROM. XDA is the first address of all your Android needs. 

Mostly every ROM which are based on LineageOS has more possibilities for customization. Like other desktop-operating systems (Arch, Debian, Mint, Ubuntu etc.) you have to find out for yourself which ROM suits you best.
