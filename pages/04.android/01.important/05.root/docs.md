**Root** is important to reach the **full control** of your **device**. It's necessary for certain apps like AFWall+, XPrivacyLUA etc. (later more)<br>
AFWall+, for example, is using the iptables firewall ([Wikipedia - link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables)) which you can only change if your device is rooted. It's like the administrator of a software.

You have to be very **careful** to use the **right root applications**. Check the mantainer, date (how long is it available) and is it open source! A _root app_ also has full control over your device! Remember, when you install a _root app_.

Some device manufacturers give **no guarantee** if they know that you have used root. We never had the problem, but that does not change the fact that some manufacturers do not give you the guarantee!

No over-the-air updates (OTA) with root. This means that your device will no longer receive updates from Google, Samsung, etc. Well, it doesn't matter! **LineageOS** updates are usually **available** even **longer** than your manufacturer!

Applications such as bank **apps** may **stop working** when they **detect a rooted phone**. You can still use your browser, laptop/desktop PC or easiest way to use Magisk-Root to hide root for specific apps.

But **root is not necessary**!<br>
You could go with a Custom ROM but there is no need to use root. For privacy reasons, it is easier to use root, but there are some options without root.
