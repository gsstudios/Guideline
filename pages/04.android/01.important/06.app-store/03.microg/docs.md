[microG](https://microg.org/) isn't a store as well but if you use yalp it is good to have microG too. Some apps are using the old [GCM](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/) or the new [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/). This is important to get messages (notifications) from your apps.
