**Root** is required if you want to have **full control** of your **device**. It's necessary for certain apps like AFWall+, XPrivacyLUA etc. (more on this later)<br>
AFWall+, for example, is using the iptables firewall ([Wikipedia - link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables)) which you can only be modified if your device is rooted. It's like the administrator of a software.

You have to be very **careful** to use the **right root applications**. Check the mantainer, date (how long is it available) and if it is open source! A _root app_ also has full control over your device! You must remember this whenever you install a _root app_.

Rooting your phone typically voids your **warranty**, however this can be **reversible** depending on a case-by-case basis. We have never had a problem, but that does not change the fact that some manufacturers may not outright accept your phone for repair should it every be necessary!

Over-the-air (OTA) updates are not possible with root. This means that your device will no longer receive updates from your smartphone manufacturer. This brings us to the use of custom ROMs. **LineageOS** can support your device (security updates, etc.) even if your device is not longer supported by your smartphone manufacturer! All new security patches straight from Google ([Android Security Bulletin - link](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin)) are included in all official builds of LineageOS. 

Applications such as **bank** apps may **stop working** when they **detect a rooted phone**. You can still use your web browser or a laptop/desktop PC, however there are solutions such as **Magisk hide** that can hide root for specific apps.

But **root is not necessary**!<br>
You could go with a custom ROM but there is no need to use root. For privacy reasons, it is easier to use root, but there are some options without root.
