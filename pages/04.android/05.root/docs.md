Root is important to reach the full control of your device. <br>
It's necessary for certain apps like AFWall+, XPrivacyLUA etc. (later more)<br>
AFWall+, for example, is using the iptables firewall ([Wikipedia - link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables)) which you can only change if your device is rooted. It's like the administrator of a software.

You have to be very careful to use the right applications. Check the mantainer, date (how long is it available) and is it open source! A _root app_ also has full control over your device! Remember, when you install a _root app_.

Root is not necessary! You could go with a Custom ROM but there is no need to use root. For privacy reasons, it is easier to use root, but there are some options without root.
